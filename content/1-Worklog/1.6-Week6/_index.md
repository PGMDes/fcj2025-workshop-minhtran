### Week 6 Objectives:

- Review foundational database (DB) concepts, including RDBMS (primary key, foreign key), optimization techniques (Index, Partition), and operational concepts (Database Log, Buffer).
- Clearly differentiate between the two main DB system types: **OLTP** (Online Transaction Processing) and **OLAP** (Online Analytical Processing or Data Warehouse).
- Understand the managed relational database service **Amazon RDS**, including core features like **Multi-AZ** (for high availability) and **Read Replicas** (for read performance).
- Learn about **Amazon Aurora**, AWS's cloud-native DB service, with its unique shared storage architecture, high performance, and superior features like **Zero Replication Lag**.
- Learn about **Amazon Redshift**, the petabyte-scale Data Warehouse service designed for OLAP, and understand its **MPP** architecture and **Columnar Storage** technique.
- Understand the role of **Amazon ElastiCache** (Redis, Memcached) as a high-speed caching layer to reduce load on the primary database.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:

| Day 	| Task 	| Start Date 	| Completion Date 	| Reference Material 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| 2 	| **Database Concepts**<br><br>- **Lesson:** Review fundamental database concepts like **Database** (a structured information system) and **Session** (a working session).<br>- **Learn about architecture:** Relational Databases (RDBMS), including **Primary Key** (to uniquely identify a row) and **Foreign Key** (to create links between tables).<br>- **Understand the technique:** **Normalization**, a technique of dividing data into multiple tables (using keys) to prevent data duplication.<br>- **Understand the technique:** Performance Optimization:<br>+ **Index:** A data structure that speeds up retrieval (read) operations, but increases the cost of writes.<br>+ **Partition:** Dividing a large table into many smaller parts to speed up queries.<br>+ **Execution Plan:** The set of steps the database decides to use to access data (e.g., whether to use an Index or not).<br>- **Understand the technique:** Ensuring integrity and speed:<br>+ **Database Log:** Records all changes, important for recovery and replication.<br>+ **Buffer:** A temporary storage area in RAM, helping to speed up reads because reading from RAM is faster than reading from disk.<br>- **Lesson:** Database Classification:<br>+ **RDBMS (ACID):** Fixed structure (Schema), storage optimized (Normalization), scales vertically (Vertical Scaling).<br>+ **NoSQL (BASE):** Flexible structure (Dynamic Schema), performance optimized (Denormalization), scales horizontally (Horizontal Scaling).<br>- **Lesson:** System Classification:<br>+ **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):** Transaction processing systems (banking, ordering), need to quickly handle read/write/update operations and ensure integrity (roll back).<br>+ **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):** Data Warehouse systems, store historical data for complex analysis (reporting, finding trends). 	| 13/10/2025 	| 13/10/2025 	| [Module 06](https://github.com/DazielNguyen/aws-fcj-report/blob/main/TAKE_NOTES_%26_LABS/Module_06/Take_notes_module_06.md) 	|
| 3 	| **Amazon RDS**<br><br>- **Learn about the service:** **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**, a fully managed relational database service, supporting popular engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.).<br>- **Lesson:** The goal of RDS is to automate administrative tasks (updates, backups) so users can focus on the application.<br>- **Understand the technique:** **Automated Backups** of the database and transaction logs, allowing for **Point-in-Time Recovery** within a 35-day window.<br>- **Learn about architecture:** **Multi-AZ (High Availability)**<br>+ Automatically creates a *standby* replica in another AZ.<br>+ Uses **Synchronous Replication**.<br>+ Supports **Automatic Failover** if the primary database fails.<br>- **Learn about architecture:** **Read Replicas (Read Performance Optimization)**<br>+ Creates *read-only* copies to offload the primary database (e.g., for reporting tasks).<br>+ Uses **Asynchronous Replication**, which can cause "replication lag".<br>- **Lesson:** RDS is often used for **OLTP** applications and is protected by **Security Groups**. 	| 14/10/2025 	| 14/10/2025 	| [Module 06](https://github.com/DazielNguyen/aws-fcj-report/blob/main/TAKE_NOTES_%26_LABS/Module_06/Take_notes_module_06.md) 	|
| 4 	| **Amazon Aurora**<br><br>- **Learn about the service:** **Amazon Aurora**, a database developed by AWS, compatible with MySQL/PostgreSQL, part of the RDS service but with higher performance (3-5x faster).<br>- **Learn about architecture:** The biggest difference for Aurora is the **redesigned storage layer**.<br>- **Learn about architecture:** An Aurora "Cluster" consists of 1 **Writer** (write instance) and up to 15 **Readers** (read instances), all **sharing a single (Cluster Volume) storage partition**.<br>- **Understand the technique:** Data on the Cluster Volume is **replicated 6 times across 3 AZs** to ensure durability.<br>- **Lesson:** Aurora's outstanding advantage is **Zero Replication Lag** because the Readers read from the same volume as the Writer.<br>- **Understand the technique:** Enterprise features like **Backtrack** (rewind the database without restoring) and **Global Database** (create read-only replicas in different Regions). 	| 15/10/2025 	| 15/10/2025 	| [Module 06](https://github.com/DazielNguyen/aws-fcj-report/blob/main/TAKE_NOTES_%26_LABS/Module_06/Take_notes_module_06.md) 	|
| 5 	| **Amazon Redshift**<br><br>- **Learn about the service:** **Amazon Redshift**, a petabyte-scale **Data Warehouse** service, optimized for **OLAP**.<br>- **Learn about architecture:** **Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)**.<br>+ **Leader Node:** Receives, parses, and coordinates queries.<br>+ **Compute Nodes:** Store and execute parts of the work in parallel.<br>- **Understand the technique:** **Columnar Storage**.<br>+ Unlike OLTP (stores by row), Redshift stores data from the *same column* together.<br>+ This technique is extremely efficient for analytical (OLAP) queries (e.g., `Calculate average age` only needs to read the `Age` column).<br>- **Understand the technique:** **Redshift Spectrum**, allows running SQL queries **directly on data in Amazon S3** without needing to load it.<br><br>**Amazon ElastiCache**<br><br>- **Learn about the service:** **Amazon ElastiCache**, a high-speed in-memory caching service.<br>- **Objective:** Speed up applications and **reduce the load on the primary database** (like RDS).<br>- **Learn about** supported engines: **Redis** (supports many data types, often preferred) and **Memcached**.<br>- **Lesson:** It is the user's responsibility to write and manage the **Caching Logic** (logic that decides *what* and *when* to cache) within their application. 	| 16/10/2025 	| 16/10/2025 	| [Module 06](https://github.com/DazielNguyen/aws-fcj-report/blob/main/TAKE_NOTES_%26_LABS/Module_06/Take_notes_module_06.md)	|
