Some blogs that I have been translated so far:

### [Blog 1 - New capabilities in Amazon SageMaker AI continue to transform how organizations develop AI models](3.1-Blog1/)

This blog introduces the latest features in Amazon SageMaker AI aimed at accelerating the development and deployment process for large-scale generative AI models. You will learn how Amazon SageMaker HyperPod optimizes performance through observability features that help reduce troubleshooting time from days to minutes, as well as the feature for quickly deploying open-weight models from JumpStart for inference. The article also instructs on how to seamlessly connect local development environments (like Visual Studio Code) with powerful cloud infrastructure, and how to use fully managed MLflow 3.0 to more effectively track experiments and evaluate the performance of generative AI applications.

### [Blog 2 - Improving weather forecasting accuracy using Amazon AppStream 2.0 graphic-intensive instances](3.2-Blog2/)

This blog introduces a solution to enhance weather forecasting capabilities by deploying the Common AWIPS Visualization Environment (CAVE) application on Amazon AppStream 2.0. You will learn how this service allows meteorologists to access specialized graphic tools from any device, which helps eliminate the reliance on expensive hardware and optimizes costs through a pay-per-use GPU consumption model. The article also provides technical steps ranging from creating a Linux image and optimizing the application manifest to configuring the fleet and user authentication, ensuring high performance and data security for critical forecasting tasks.

### [Blog 3 - Geospatial data lakes with Amazon Redshift](3.3-Blog3/)

This blog introduces a solution for building a secure geospatial data lake by leveraging the capabilities of Amazon Redshift and AWS Lake Formation. You will learn how to store large-scale map data on Amazon S3 and perform direct queries through Redshift Serverless without data movement, helping to optimize storage costs and analysis performance. The article provides detailed technical guidance on the process, from infrastructure deployment and using AWS Glue for metadata management, to applying security tags in Lake Formation to control column-level access, ensuring that sensitive information (such as PHI medical data) is absolutely protected. Finally, you will be guided on how to create geospatial views in Redshift and connect the ArcGIS Pro software to visualize the data on a map for real-world analytical needs.
